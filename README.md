# This might turn into a books api

## Goal

Create a simple books api that can be used to store and retrieve books.

I struggled to find an existing dataset that I was happy with.

The strategy so far has been

1. Query google books api for a list of search terms and write the responses to a json file.

2. Parse the json objects into a INSERT INTO table sql statements to populate a postgres database.

This is a work in progress. I am not sure if it will work. I am also not sure if it will be efficient. I am also not sure if it will be scalable. I am also not sure if it will be maintainable. I am also not sure if it will be easy to use. I am also not sure if it will be easy to understand.

lol clearly co-pilot things I suck and it could do a better job. Probably true.
